# Vityarthi-Project

This project is a simple Python-based, command-line tool called Disease Finder designed for educational purposes. It uses a small, hard-coded knowledge base of diseases and their associated symptoms. The user inputs their symptoms as a comma-separated list, and the program normalizes and compares these with the stored symptom lists. It computes a match score by counting how many symptoms overlap between the user input and each disease.

The disease with the highest match score is returned as the most likely disease, along with the scores for all diseases to provide transparency. The project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as dictionaries, functions, string processing, and set operations for matching and decision-making.

Designed as a starting point for learning symptom-based prediction, the project explicitly includes a disclaimer that it is not for real medical diagnosis. It can be expanded by adding more diseases, improving symptom handling, or integrating with a web or GUI interface for broader applications.
